1. Instructions on how to start your web application (this will probably include using the command npm start)

First open the zip file in VSCode and type 'npm install' in a new terminal window. Then type ‘npm start’ into the terminal. 
Next go to a web server and type localhost:3000 into the address bar.  


2. A breakdown of which members of your team contributed to the sprint and in what ways

Our team tried to break up the contributions to the sprint evenly. 
Vincent created the ‘Home’ page, as well as added various visual features on that page and altered the navigation bar. 
Karina worked on the ‘Transportation’ page and assisted other team members with organization and git issues. 
Noelle created the ‘About’ page, in addition to collaborating with Jen and Karina to design the logo and choose the color scheme. 
Lastly, Jen created the ‘Travel Advice’ and ‘Contact’ pages, as well as the wireframe pages for the ‘Lodging’ and ‘Activity Planning’ pages that 
will be further designed in the next sprint. Jen also designed the first iteration of the navigation bar that was improved by Vincent.
