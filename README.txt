1. Instructions on how to start your web application (this will probably include using the command npm start)

First open the zip file in VSCode and type 'npm install' in a new terminal window. Then type ‘npm start’ into the terminal. 
Next go to a web server and type localhost:3000 into the address bar.  


2. A breakdown of which members of your team contributed to the sprint and in what ways

Noelle worked on adjusting the HTML for the reservation page, as well as implementing the CRUD stubs. 
Jennifer worked on the API endpoint and accessing data from the MetaWeather API. This included using Ajax and JavaScript to print out the data 
into the HTML div.
Vince updated the homepage with new images of landmarks in Boston. In addition, he added new navigation into the activities page and successfully 
connected to a landmarks API, which will be used in the next sprint. 
Karina added the functionality to the transportation page, which now shows the different bus lines when the each button is pressed. This was 
implemented using a JSON structure and included data that manipulates the DOM.
