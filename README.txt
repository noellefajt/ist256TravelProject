1. Instructions on how to start your web application (this will probably include using the command npm start)

First open the zip file in VSCode and type 'npm install' in a new terminal window. Then type ‘npm start’ into the terminal. 
Next go to a web server and type localhost:3000 into the address bar.  


2. A breakdown of which members of your team contributed to the sprint and in what ways

For the final sprint, our group fixed errors, added in functionality, and implemented the CRUD use case. Noelle’s main focus was on 
the CRUD use case, where she added the reservations form and worked extensively on the create, read, update, and delete code. 
The other members assisted Noelle on the CRUD case and provided help and problem solving ideas. Karina worked on finalizing the 
functionality to the transportation page, which displays a table and images of the different bus lines, appearing when the each button 
is pressed. This was implemented using a JSON structure and included data that manipulates the DOM. Vince added the content to the 
‘Things to Do’ tab on the activity planning page, which included formatting and writing the descriptions. Similarly, Jen added the 
content to the ‘Food and Drink’ tab, which also involved formatting and writing the descriptions. Jen also fixed the implementation 
of the API, which had stopped working due to some syntax issues. Additionally, Jen fixed formatting issues regarding image and text 
placement on the home and about pages.
